Multiples of 3 and 5
Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Notes: This is essentially FizzBuzz but with more rules. I took a unique approach and the solution isn't efficient or elegant but it tackles the problem in a different way to the conventional solution.
